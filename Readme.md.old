## Dataset 
Follow the process of [UPT](https://github.com/fredzzhang/upt).

```

## Dependencies
1. Follow the environment setup in [UPT](https://github.com/fredzzhang/upt).

2. Follow the environment setup in [ADA-CM](https://github.com/ltttpku/ADA-CM/tree/main).

**Reminder**: 
If you have already installed the clip package in your Python environment (e.g., via pip install clip), please ensure that you use the local CLIP directory provided in our EZ-HOI repository instead. To do this, set the  `PYTHONPATH` to include the local CLIP path so that it takes precedence over the installed package.
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:"your_path/HOLa/CLIP"
```
So that you can use the local clip **without uninstall the clip of your python env**.

3. modify the installed [pocket](https://github.com/fredzzhang/pocket) library as mentioned [here](https://github.com/ChelsieLei/EZ-HOI/issues/2)

## Scripts
### Train / Test on HICO-DET:

Using vit-B image backbone:
```
bash scripts/hico_vitB.sh
```

Using vit-L image backbone:
```
bash scripts/hico_vitL.sh
```


### Train / Test on V-COCO:

Using vit-L image backbone:
```
bash scripts/vcoco.sh
```
